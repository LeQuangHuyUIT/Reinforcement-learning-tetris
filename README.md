# Reinforcement-learning-tetris
Cross entropy method to train an agent to play tetris. The agent finally can delete around 5000-10000 blocks
In this method, we are using small feature space and large feature space. You can find them through the name of the file :)
Meanwhile, we propose a new method, which is called SA-CEM, which combined Simulated annealing and CEM. The result is relatively good. Because of the time limitation,the performance of SA-CEM does not reach the maximum. If you are intrested in, you can keep running it.
Following is the result:
